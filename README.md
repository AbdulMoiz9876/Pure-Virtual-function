# Pure-Virtual-function
A pure virtual function in c++ is defined as a function that is only initialized but not defined.
A pure virtual function in c++ must end with " =0 " when declared. 
This type of function is a concept of Run-time Polymorphism.
This type of function needs to be redefined in the derived class.
A pure virtual function or pure virtual method is a virtual function that is required to be implemented by a derived class if the derived class is not abstract. 
Classes containing pure virtual methods are termed "abstract" and they cannot be instantiated directly.
